        "id": "M1", "tier": 1, "color": "amber", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Net Revenue by Market",
        "q": "Where is our revenue actually coming from — US, UK, India, or rest of world?",
        "problem": "Without market-level revenue breakdown you can't tell if growth is concentrated in one market masking decline in another, or whether currency exposure is distorting the top line.",
        "why": "Drives resource allocation, market-specific pricing decisions, and determines where to direct the next acquisition dollar. The foundation every other market strategy is built on.",
        "sql": "Metric 1 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M2", "tier": 1, "color": "amber", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "New vs Returning Revenue",
        "q": "Is growth coming from new customer acquisition or from existing customers buying again?",
        "problem": "Blended revenue hides whether you're on a treadmill — churn replacing acquisition at net zero customer growth — or genuinely compounding. A business that looks like it's growing can be dying if returning revenue % is falling.",
        "why": "If returning revenue share declines month over month, you have a retention problem even while total revenue grows. This single ratio diagnoses acquisition dependency before it becomes a crisis.",
        "sql": "Metric 2 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M3", "tier": 1, "color": "teal", "src": "shopify",
        "name": "LTV:CAC Ratio by Channel",
        "q": "Is each acquisition channel generating more lifetime value than it costs to acquire customers from it?",
        "problem": "CAC alone is meaningless without LTV context. A $50 CAC is brilliant if LTV is $300 and destructive if LTV is $55. Channels below 3:1 destroy value with every customer acquired.",
        "why": "The single most important channel health check. Determines which channels to scale, which to pause, and where reallocated budget will compound fastest. Below 2:1 for two consecutive months is a stop signal.",
        "sql": "Metric 3 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M4", "tier": 1, "color": "purple", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Repeat Purchase Rate 90d",
        "q": "What percentage of new buyers come back within 90 days — by monthly cohort?",
        "problem": "A blended repeat rate hides whether the rate is improving or deteriorating. Viewing it by cohort reveals whether a product change, channel shift, or flow modification caused a structural change in customer behaviour.",
        "why": "The 90-day repeat rate is the best single predictor of long-term LTV for a consumable DTC brand. A cohort with a higher 90d rate will be worth 2–4× more at 12 months. Every strategy decision should move this number.",
        "sql": "Metric 4 in queries/metrics.sql",

    {
        "id": "M5", "tier": 1, "color": "amber", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Gross Margin % by Product Type",
        "q": "Which product categories actually make money after cost of goods — and which are eroding profitability?",
        "problem": "Revenue without margin context is vanity. A high-revenue SKU at 10% margin funds less future growth than a mid-revenue SKU at 65% margin. Promotion and acquisition decisions made without this view optimise for the wrong outcome.",
        "why": "Sets the floor for viable CAC per product type, determines which SKUs to prioritise in paid acquisition, and drives subscription pricing decisions. Required input for any unit-economics model.",
        "sql": "Metric 5 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    # Tier 2
    {
        "id": "M6", "tier": 2, "color": "teal", "src": "shopify",
        "name": "CAC by Channel",
        "q": "How much does it actually cost to acquire one new customer from each marketing channel?",
        "problem": "Marketing spend without per-channel CAC creates budget allocation by gut feel. Channels that look productive by session volume often have the worst cost-per-new-customer once the denominator is right.",
        "why": "The denominator in LTV:CAC. Without accurate CAC you can't know whether any channel is profitable. Also exposes which channels bring in high-intent vs low-intent traffic, which informs creative strategy.",
        "sql": "Metric 6 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M7", "tier": 2, "color": "purple", "src": "klaviyo",
        "name": "Email Revenue % by Month",
        "q": "What share of total net revenue can be directly attributed to Klaviyo campaigns and flows?",
        "problem": "If email isn't contributing at least 20% of revenue, critical flows are missing or the list is unhealthy. Over-reliance on paid acquisition — where 100% of marginal revenue costs money — makes growth fragile and expensive.",
        "why": "Email and SMS are the highest-ROI owned channels. Knowing their revenue share tells you how much defensible, low-cost revenue you have vs paid-dependent revenue. A growing email % reduces overall CAC structurally.",
        "sql": "Metric 7 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M8", "tier": 2, "color": "amber", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "AOV Trend MoM",
        "q": "Is the average order value increasing, flat, or declining month over month — and what is causing it?",
        "problem": "Flat AOV with stable order count means revenue is stagnating. Without MoM tracking, bundle and upsell effectiveness is invisible — you can't tell if pricing changes, promotions, or product launches moved the needle.",
        "why": "AOV × purchase frequency = LTV. A 10% AOV improvement compounds across every customer. It also signals whether discounting is eroding basket value or whether upsell strategies are working.",
        "sql": "Metric 8 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M9", "tier": 2, "color": "blue", "src": "webengage",
        "name": "Checkout Conversion Funnel",
        "q": "At which exact stage — product view, add-to-cart, checkout, or payment — are we losing the most customers?",
        "problem": "If 70% of people who add to cart never complete a purchase, every dollar spent on acquisition is partially wasted. Funnel leaks are invisible without stage-by-stage event data — Shopify's native analytics only show the final conversion rate.",
        "why": "Funnel improvements multiply all upstream marketing spend. A fix that recovers 5% of cart abandonment benefits every channel simultaneously. This is the highest-leverage conversion investment available.",
        "sql": "Metric 9 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M10", "tier": 2, "color": "coral", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Subscription Mix %",
        "q": "What percentage of monthly revenue comes from subscription orders vs one-time purchases?",
        "problem": "One-time orders create unpredictable, lumpy revenue. Every month starts from zero. Subscription revenue compounds: once a customer subscribes, revenue from that customer is near-certain until they cancel.",
        "why": "Subscription mix directly determines revenue predictability, LTV ceiling, and business valuation multiple. Moving from 20% to 50% subscription mix can increase valuation 2–3× on the same revenue base.",
        "sql": "Metric 10 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    # Tier 3
    {
        "id": "M11", "tier": 3, "color": "purple", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Cohort Retention 30/60/90d",
        "q": "Are customers still buying at 30, 60, and 90 days after their first purchase — and where does the cohort drop off?",
        "problem": "A single repeat rate doesn't show WHERE the drop-off happens. If 30-day retention is 15% but 60-day is also 15%, no one returns after the first window. If 30d is 5% and 90d is 25%, customers are slow starters — not churning.",
        "why": "Determines optimal flow trigger timing. If median second purchase is at day 45, a day-7 re-engagement email is firing 38 days too early. Cohort shape is the structural input for every post-purchase automation.",
        "sql": "Metric 11 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M12", "tier": 3, "color": "purple", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Time to 2nd Purchase",
        "q": "How many days does it typically take for a customer to make their second purchase — by market?",
        "problem": "Post-purchase flows fire at arbitrary intervals by default. If your re-engagement email fires at day 60 but customers who return typically do so at day 21, you're missing the conversion window by 6 weeks — and attributing the miss to the product rather than the timing.",
        "why": "The single structural input that sets trigger timing for every Klaviyo post-purchase flow. Run once per market segment. If US median is 21 days and UK is 45 days, flows need different timing by market to be effective.",
        "sql": "Metric 12 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M13", "tier": 3, "color": "purple", "src": "klaviyo",
        "name": "Churn Risk Distribution",
        "q": "How many of our active customers are predicted by Klaviyo's model to churn in the next 90 days?",
        "problem": "Churn is invisible until it registers in revenue — typically 2–3 months after the behaviour change. Klaviyo's predictive score gives a 30–90 day early warning window. Without it, you win-back customers who have already bought elsewhere.",
        "why": "Win-back is 5–7× cheaper than new acquisition. Acting on predicted churn before it happens is the highest-ROI retention lever. Knowing the distribution tells you the scale of the risk — and whether it requires urgent reallocation of budget.",
        "sql": "Metric 13 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M14", "tier": 3, "color": "coral", "src": "klaviyo",
        "name": "At-Risk Revenue",
        "q": "What is the total predicted 12-month CLV of customers currently flagged as high-risk or winback — by market?",
        "problem": "Retention investment decisions require a dollar figure. '500 at-risk customers' doesn't move a budget conversation. '$180K in predicted CLV is at risk this quarter' does. This metric converts churn probability into a concrete revenue line.",
        "why": "Makes the business case for win-back campaign spend quantifiable. If 30% of at-risk CLV can be recovered, the expected recovery amount directly sets the maximum viable spend on win-back flows and incentives.",
        "sql": "Metric 14 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "M15", "tier": 3, "color": "coral", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "Product Repeat Rate (Top 10)",
        "q": "Which specific SKUs are most effective at bringing customers back — regardless of what they buy on their next order?",
        "problem": "Not all products are equal as customer relationship openers. A low-priced sampler might generate more lifetime value than a premium SKU by pulling customers into repeat purchase behaviour. Without this view, acquisition targets high-margin products that may not retain.",
        "why": "Identifies 'gateway SKUs' — the products that open long-term customer relationships. These are your highest-value acquisition targets and your top subscription conversion candidates. Combined with Metric 10, reveals SKUs that retain well but are under-subscribed.",
        "sql": "Metric 15 in queries/metrics.sql",
    },
    {
        "id": "BONUS", "tier": 3, "color": "teal", "src": "matrixify",
        "name": "LTV by Market",
        "q": "Are US, UK, and India customers worth the same over their lifetime — and should we have a different CAC ceiling per market?",
        "problem": "Applying the same CAC ceiling to all markets is wrong if LTV differs significantly. If UK customers have 2× the LTV of US customers, you're systematically overspending in the US and underspending in the UK.",
        "why": "The market-level LTV split determines the correct CAC ceiling per geography — which is the primary input for media budget allocation. A market with 50% higher LTV can justify 50% higher CAC before the same 3:1 ratio breaks.",
        "sql": "BONUS query in queries/metrics.sql",
